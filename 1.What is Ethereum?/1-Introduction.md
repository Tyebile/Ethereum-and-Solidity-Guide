1. Ethereum network used to store data and transfer of money and the storage of data are what aloow us to create interesting applications which is the entire goal of Ethereum
2. There are main network and test network
3. Node is a machine that is running in Ethereum. We take a node, and install some software on it. We run that software and then it connects to Ethereum network and starts becoming a part of the network overall.
4. Anyone can run a node. Each node onn the network has a full copy of the blockchain.
5. The blockchain is being like a database that a record of evey movement of money between different parties and that's also where we store data.

1. You can think of Web3.js as being our sort of portal where our window into the Ethereum network and it's going to allow us to send monney,store data,deploy contracts or do essentially whatever we want.
2. Metamask and Mist Browser are used for consumers. We are going to be getting a trmendous amount of experience with Metamask.

## Metamask Setup

Rinkeby Test Network is where we are going to be deploying a lot of test conntracts that we write and we'll also use it for a lot of other pruposes as well.
